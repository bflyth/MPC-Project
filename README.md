## The Model
Describe the model in detail, including the state, actuators, and update equations. 

MPC consists of:
1. Vehicle trajectory with a number of timesteps (N) and a time step duration (dt).
2. Vehicle state and actuation variables that have upper and lower constraints. 
	* x and y positions
	* psi - yaw angle
	* v - velocity 
	* cte - cross track error
	* epsi - error in yaw angle
	* delta - steering angle
	* a - acceleration
3. A cost function that optimizes actuation for two systems... achieving a speed close to the reference velocity (ref_v), and a trajectory close to the reference path.
	My weights were determined roughly from the Q&A video as a baseline, then adjusted to minimums as I toyed with (ref_v).
	I made sure to include a cost function to penalize high velocity turns to make sure a car would not lose contact with the road or flip.
	There is also a cost function to penalize rapid actuations. This should limit the wavering steering that is classic of CTE functions, and should relax the throttle to reduce stop and go.
	
## Timestep Length and Duration
Discuss the reasoning behind the chosen (N) and (dt) values. Provide details of previous values used.

(N) and (dt) are related in the sense that (N)*(dt) is the predictive range of the model. I tried to use values that would result in 4-7 seconds of range - such as 80 and .05 or 40 and .1 - but chose 10 steps and 100 ms, because the latency is expected to be 100 ms.

## Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing
A polynomial is fitted to waypoints. If preprocess waypoints, the vehicle state, and/or actuators prior to the MPC procedure it is described.

The yellow line in the simulator is the reference trajectory fitted to a third order polynomial through reference points.

Waypoints are shifted global coordinates to vehicle reference in lines 112-120.

## Model Predictive Control With Latency
Implement Model Predictive Control that handles a 100 millisecond latency. Provides details on how to deal with latency.

The MPC manages 100 ms latency by predicting actuations 100 ms in advance. I accomplished this in lines 132-144 where I multiplied each relevant state variable - x, y, psi and v - by the latency of .1 seconds. 
These state variables are then replaced in the state vector and passed to mpc.solve. This allows the car to move around the track with a top speed of 70 mph, more than enough for most interstates.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.)
4.  Tips for setting up your environment are available [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)
5. **VM Latency:** Some students have reported differences in behavior using VM's ostensibly a result of latency.  Please let us know if issues arise as a result of a VM environment.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
